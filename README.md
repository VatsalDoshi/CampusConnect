# CampusConnect

This project uses Interface Builder for designing the user interface and storyboards for a hands-on approach with View Controllers and Table View Controllers. The app's design includes various elements like programs, courses, colleges, and course categories, all of which can be created, read, updated, or deleted. A SQLite database is used for organizing and storing data effectively, which helps in accessing campus information quickly and reliably. We've also used mock APIs to fetch and display detailed information and images, making the app more engaging and realistic for users. The app is designed with Auto Layout, ensuring it looks good and works well on different device sizes and screen orientations. Users can easily search and find what they need by filtering through options like program or college name. The app is built to handle errors smoothly and provides feedback to users on their actions. Also, when information is updated in one part of the app, these changes are correctly reflected in all related areas, keeping everything consistent and up-to-date.
